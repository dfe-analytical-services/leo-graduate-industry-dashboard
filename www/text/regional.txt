This tab compares where graduates studied to where they lived at one, three and five years after graduation, for each industry, and uses the latest tax year data, so does not follow the same cohort as the longitudinal tab. It can be filtered to look at graduates of a specific subject and provides context on the number of providers in each region that have graduates working in the selected industry, and the median earnings of graduates working in the selected industry in each region.
